1. Chakra/theme UI uses lots and lots of references to sizes, etc.
2. Chakra variants are truly variable, since they are computed.  Such as ghost
3. Chakra fontSize in theme spec doesn't seem to match the docs (ex: fontSize md is rendered as rem, but in the docs its pixels)
4. May need to support multiple rule properties to handle hover+disabled
5. Chakra uses _hover for hover in pseudos
6.
